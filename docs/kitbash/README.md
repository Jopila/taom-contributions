# Kitbash catalogs

Persistent reference documentation for the kitbash asset families in TAOM.
Each subfolder catalogs one kit with its textures, materials, meshes, and
composition patterns — so future design sessions can compose prefabs from
outside the editor without re-learning the asset layout every time.

## Kits

| Kit | Location | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Erebor (dwarven) | [erebor/](erebor/) | Full, measured 2026-10-15: every one of the 145 pieces (size, pivot, slope, openings, LODs, collision body), the frame rule (the engine reads each Erebor FBX turned 180 degrees about Z from Blender's import), the join matrix tested in Blender and recipes taken from the authored prefabs |
| Erebor buildings | [erebor-buildings.md](erebor-buildings.md) | Whole buildings assembled from the Erebor kit and exported as one FBX each (base, `.lod3`, `.lod6`, `bo_`), #797: the pipeline, the export proof for the frame rule, the probe stack. Three buildings exported, probed and imported in the Kit 2026-10-15: `erebor_dwarf_house_01` (approved), `erebor_great_hall_01` and `erebor_barracks_01` |
| Mirkwood (elven) | — | Not catalogued yet (referenced in `taom_mirkwood_kitbash.xml`) |
| Gondor | [gondor/](gondor/) | Full, measured 2026-10-15 (the kit is referenced in `taom_gondor_kitbash.xml`): 330 kit parts (part families: sub-objects, LODs per sub-object, one `bo_` per prefix) and 166 props and references, the frame rule proved again (the Erebor 180 degrees about Z), 15 joins mined from 51,491 prefab placements and tested in Blender, the Lond Cirion rules re-checked and a proposed building list; [gondor/blender-build-prompt.md](gondor/blender-build-prompt.md) is the prompt behind it. 2026-07-28: added harbor ships `sm_gondor_ship_{cog,longship,war}_001` (Tripo AI sources, 1.9M→40k decimation + chart re-UV + high-to-low rebake) + `t_gondor_ship_<name>_{d,n,s}` under `Scenes/Gondor/ships/{,textures/}`; pipeline: [ue-to-bannerlord-asset-pipeline.md](../reference/ue-to-bannerlord-asset-pipeline.md) § Single-prop path. |
| Gondor buildings | [gondor-buildings.md](gondor-buildings.md) | Six buildings (town house, townhouse, watch tower, barracks, hall, market arcade) assembled from the Gondor part families and exported in one FBX, `buildings_taom/gondor_buildings_a.fbx` (four tier objects each), 2026-10-15: recipes, probe results, shared faces judged per plane |
| Lond Cirion walls | [lond-cirion-walls.md](lond-cirion-walls.md) | Full — 8 ploppable sections (L, gatehouse straight, straight, kinks, gate court, sweep, the assembled ring with open siege frontage) composed programmatically from the Gondor castle L3 pieces; registration facts, the three composition laws, assembler workflow. |
| Lond Cirion buildings | [lond-cirion-buildings.md](lond-cirion-buildings.md) | Full — 2 pilot houses composed from the Gondor `meshes/` **part families** (panels, trims, roofs, columns, ground tiles) rather than whole pieces; the six placement rules the parts force (decal trap, bare-`.lod` trap, origin-anchored parts, gable seating, flush trims, skirt part choice), deliberate deviations, and the ray-probe verification stack. |
| Mordor | — | Not catalogued yet (referenced in `taom_mordor_kitbash.xml`). 2026-07-25: added `sm_mordor_mm_throne_001` (Witch-king throne, Tripo AI source, chart re-UV + rebake) + `t_mordor_mm_throne_{d,n,s}` — single-prop pipeline: [ue-to-bannerlord-asset-pipeline.md](../reference/ue-to-bannerlord-asset-pipeline.md) § Single-prop path. Uses `t_`-prefix material naming like Rivendell/Tents. |
| Rivendell (elven) | — | Converted from the ElvenForestCity UE 5.1 kit (2026-07-15): 458 modular meshes + ~660 textures + 196 generated materials in `TAOM_Map/AssetSources/Scenes/Rivendell/`. Not catalogued yet. Pipeline: [ue-to-bannerlord-asset-pipeline.md](../reference/ue-to-bannerlord-asset-pipeline.md). **Naming exception:** materials are named `t_rivendell_<set>` (== their texture set, user decision) — no `m_` prefix. |
| Tents (culture-neutral) | — | Fab Medieval Tent Collection (2026-07-16): one kit FBX (`Scenes/Tents/tents_medieval_kit.fbx`, 9 tents + `bo_` twins, wood physics) + `t_tent_*` texture sets (white/clear canvas only). Wide-family + On_Sticks textures missing from the vault (pending re-download). Same `t_`-material naming as Rivendell. |

## Naming conventions (shared across all TAOM kits)

Prefixes:
- `t_<kit>_...` — raw texture asset (.dds / .png files)
- `m_<kit>_...` — material asset (references textures, applies shader parameters)
- `sm_<kit>_...` — static mesh asset (references materials)
- `bo_<mesh_id>` — collision body paired with a visual mesh of the same base name

Kit prefixes used in TAOM: `dw` (dwarven — Erebor), `gd` (Gondor), `mordor`
(Mordor), `mirkwood` (Mirkwood), `nat` (nature — shared across kits).

Channel suffixes on textures:
- `_d` — diffuse (base colour)
- `_d2`, `_d3`, `_d4` — alternate diffuse maps that share the same `_n`/`_s`
  (used for color-swap families like obsidian black/blue/green/red)
- `_n` — normal map
- `_s` — specular map
- `_h` — height map (parallax / displacement)

## How to use these catalogs

When you need to compose a building prefab by writing positional XML:
1. Start at the kit's `design-patterns.md` — reusable templates.
2. Use `meshes.md` to select specific pieces (each entry notes shape + typical use).
3. Reference `materials.md` only when a mesh's implied texture is unclear.
4. Reference `textures.md` rarely — mostly when authoring new materials.

When you learn something new during a build iteration (pivot quirk,
dimension, rotation convention), update the relevant file immediately so
the knowledge persists to the next session.
