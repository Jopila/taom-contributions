// The player's kingdom learns of a call-to-war offer here (an alliance start, or a war on the player's
// kingdom with an ally not yet in it). With a one-clan kingdom vanilla posts a map notice for the offer
// and never reads IsAllowed, so the two ballot patches cannot cancel it; accepting the notice would
// reach StartCallToWarAgreement, which refuses a forbidden war only after the player saw the offer.
// Skipping here for a war the rule refuses keeps the notice off the map. A larger kingdom's ballot is
// skipped too, which is the same outcome as its IsAllowed patches cancelling it. The veto is the
// DeclareWarAction prefix's own (ShouldPreventWarDeclaration, which defers to the host under co-op).
// Initialize is wired in DiplomacyIoC.InitializeHooks.
