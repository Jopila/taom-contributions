// A call-to-war agreement moves gold (the caller's or the player's wallet to the called kingdom's) and
// only then declares the war through DeclareWarAction.ApplyByCallToWarAgreement, whose prefix would
// refuse a war the phase forbids after the gold had already moved. Skipping the agreement here keeps
// both the gold and the agreement out of a war that cannot start. The veto is the DeclareWarAction
// prefix's own (ShouldPreventWarDeclaration, which defers to the host under co-op). Initialize is wired
// in DiplomacyIoC.InitializeHooks.
